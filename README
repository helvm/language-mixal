MIXAL Parser etc
================

This package provides a parser, a pretty-printer, and an AST for the
MIXAL assembly language.  To see this in use, see the `mix-assembler`
package.

To try it out on a test program:

    $ cabal-dev install
    $ cabal-dev/bin/mixal-pretty test.mixal

The above will just parse and then pretty-print the parsed MIXAL
program.
